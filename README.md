Sir, I sincerely don't understand why you would need encapsulation, 
and didn't realize i needed it until i re-read the criteria to check 
if i met all of the requirements.

So i dont have that.

Otherwise there shouldn't be any errors, unless the contact.txt is not with the .exe
I'm fairly sure all of your other requirements are met though, maybe not the naming conventions.
